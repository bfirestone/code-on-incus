"""
Test build subcommand with end-to-end functionality.

Flow:
1. Check if coi-sandbox image exists
2. If not, attempt to build it (or skip test if takes too long)
3. If exists, verify we can launch container from it
4. Clean up test container

Expected:
- Build command works for core images
- Built images are usable for launching containers
- Build handles existing images correctly
